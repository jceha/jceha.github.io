**Are you interested in going to grad school?** Having worked in numerous academic labs, with various advisors, and in different countries, I've learned a lot about the experience and am happy to share with those interested generally in grad school, or if you have questions about specific advisors, universities, or labs! There are a number of things I wish I had known before starting, which can impact your overall experience and what you will get out of doing a grad program.<br>

Please feel free to connect with me if you're curious, and I'd be happy to share my experiences!
