I am a second year Ph.D. student in the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](http://hci.uwaterloo.ca/) at the University of Waterloo, advised by [Dr. Edith Law](http://edithlaw.ca/). My interest lies in increasing our understanding of cognition so that we can develop innovative, intuitive interactions, specifically those that can improve the lives of people. To this end, my research currently focuses on curiosity-driven teaching and learning.

Prior to Waterloo, I completed an M.Sc. _cum laude_, in [Human-Machine Communication](http://www.rug.nl/masters/human-machine-communication/) from the University of Groningen, in the Netherlands, in 2016, within the [Department of Artificial Intelligence at the Bernoulli Institute](https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/research/departments), and a B.Sc. in [Cognitive Systems](http://cogsys.ubc.ca/): Cognition and Brain, from the University of British Columbia, in 2014.

Alongside my Master's I obtained an [Honours Master in High Tech Systems and Materials](http://www.rug.nl/education/honours-college/htsm-masterprogramme/), a program offered by the University of Groningen, in cooperation with [Innovation Cluster - Philips, Drachten](https://en.icdrachten.nl/companies/philips). The program culmintated in a research internship at Philips Consumer Lifestyle in Drachten, the Netherlands, where I manufactured and tested an innovative consumer electronics product.
