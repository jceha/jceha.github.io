In September 2017 I started my Ph.D. in the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](http://hci-cs.cs.uwaterloo.ca/) in the School of Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I am advised by [Dr. Edith Law](http://edithlaw.ca/). Prior to Waterloo, I completed an M.Sc. _cum laude_, in [Human-Machine Communication](http://www.rug.nl/masters/human-machine-communication/) (2016) from the University of Groningen in the Netherlands, within the [Department of Artificial Intelligence at the Bernoulli Institute](https://www.rug.nl/research/bernoulli/research/departments), and a B.Sc. in [Cognitive Systems](https://cogsys.ubc.ca/about-cogs-2/): Cognition and Brain (2014), from the University of British Columbia in Canada. 

Alongside my Master's I obtained an [Honours Master in High Tech Systems and Materials](http://www.rug.nl/education/honours-college/htsm-masterprogramme/), a program offered by the University of Groningen, in cooperation with the [Innovation Cluster - Philips, Drachten](https://en.icdrachten.nl/companies/philips). The program culmintated in a research internship at Philips where I manufactured and tested an innovative consumer electronics product.

My research interests began with increasing our understanding of human cognition in order to better design interactions with technology, specifically those that can improve the lives of people. During my Master's I concentrated on improving voice perception for cochlear implant wearers, developing an electroencephalography (EEG) brain-computer interface, as well as conducting psychoacoustic experiments to investigate how the comparison and integration of the different sound signals in bimodal hearing impacts perception of voice characteristics in speech. This interest in human cognition has led me to my current research on socially assistive robots and computer agents. The focus in this field is on assisting users through social rather than physical interaction, and to this end my Ph.D. research concerns designing conversational interactions that promote social experiences, specifically for education.
