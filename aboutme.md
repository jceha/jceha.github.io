I am a second year Ph.D. student in the [Human-Computer Interaction Lab](http://hci.uwaterloo.ca/) at the University of Waterloo, advised by [Dr. Edith Law](http://edithlaw.ca/). My interest lies in increasing our understanding of cognition so that we can develop innovative, intuitive interactions, specifically those that can improve the lives of people. To this end, my research currently focuses on curiosity-driven teaching and learning.
