| **Theta Oscillation Phase-Locking.** EEG study on theta oscillation phase-locking after attentional blink (AB) training.| **ACT-R Cognitive Architecture.** How Are Time Representations Stored in Memory and What is the Influence of Feedback? | **Interruption Management System.** Based on pupil dilation as a measure of cognitive workload. (Similar work published by colleagues: [https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2016.1198525](  https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2016.1198525)) |

**HUMAN-ROBOT INTERACTION** (2015-2016)

| **The Search For A Waving Person.** With the use of a Kinect sensor and ROS modules a behaviour was built which searched for a waving person in a room by rotating on the spot by small intervals. Once the person was found the robot navigated to him or her and stopped directly in front at a face-to-face angle. Experiments were conducted to measure the accuracy of the behaviour.| **EMG-Powered Robotic Hand.** Completed a project for [Science LinX](https://www.rug.nl/sciencelinx/), an organization which aims to familiarize high school students with science through interactive exhibits and workshops throughout the Netherlands. Together with a graduate physics student, created a prototype of an interactive system demonstrating the idea behind neuroprosthetics. |
