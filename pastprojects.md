</p>

Completed a project for [Science LinX](https://www.rug.nl/sciencelinx/), an organization which aims to familiarize high school students with science through interactive exhibits and workshops throughout the Netherlands. Together with a graduate physics student, created a prototype of an interactive system demonstrating the idea behind neuroprosthetics.
