**Teachable Agents**<br>
Curiosity a well-studied psychological phenomenon and a powerful motivating factor designers can leverage to increase user engagement, particularly in applications requiring long-term interaction (e.g., tutoring systems, health tracking tools). In the teachable robot project, we aim to design a teachable robot agent with the explicit goal of inducing students' curiosity about the material being taught, and use the teachable robot agent as an experimentation platform to study technology-mediated peer learning.

**Neural Correlates of Curiosity**<br>
In collaboration with [Inria Bordeaux](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/bordeaux), we are currently running an EEG study to explore the neural correlates of curiosity.
