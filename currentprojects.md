						Teachable Agents
					</strong>

				<p>
					Curiosity a well-studied psychological phenomenon and a powerful motivating factor designers can leverage to increase user engagement, particularly in applications requiring long-term interaction (e.g., tutoring systems, health tracking tools). In the teachable robot project, we aim to design a teachable robot agent with the explicit goal of inducing student's curiosity about the material being taught, and use the teachable robot agent as an experimentation platform to study technology-mediated peer learning.
