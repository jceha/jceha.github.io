Curiosity a well-studied psychological phenomenon and a powerful motivating factor designers can leverage to increase user engagement, particularly in applications requiring long-term interaction (e.g., tutoring systems, health tracking tools). In the teachable robot project, we aim to design a teachable robot agent with the explicit goal of inducing students' curiosity about the material being taught, and use the teachable robot agent as an experimentation platform to study technology-mediated peer learning.

We worked with teachers to conceptualize possible robot roles and the effects they may have on the current way learning activities are designed, planned, and executed.

In collaboration with [Inria Bordeaux](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/bordeaux), we are currently running an EEG study to explore the neural correlates of curiosity.
