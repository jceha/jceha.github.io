| In this project we aim to design a social robot peer with the explicit goal of inducing students' curiosity. | Working with teachers to conceptualize possible robot functions and the effects they may have on the current way learning activities are designed, planned, and executed. |

Curiosity is a well-studied psychological phenomenon and a powerful motivating factor designers can leverage to increase user engagement, particularly in applications requiring long-term interaction (e.g., tutoring systems and health tracking tools). In the Curious Robot project, we aim to design a teachable social robot with the explicit goal of inducing students' curiosity about the material being taught, and use the teachable robot as an experimentation platform to study technology-mediated peer learning.

We worked with teachers to conceptualize possible robot roles and the effects they may have on the current way learning activities are designed, planned, and executed.

|:---:|
| Designed, built, and deployed an Amazon Alexa Skill [Alien Invasion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MK_amN7jztg), with two colleagues: Nalin Chhibber and Sangho Suh, as part of the _Alexa Skills Challenge: Kids_, a competition to publish an Alexa skill for children under 13. |


**NEURAL CORRELATES OF CURIOSITY** (2017-present)

| [[img src="/img/NeuralCuriosity.png" alt="" width="300px"]] |
|:---:|
| In collaboration with [Inria Bordeaux](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/bordeaux), we are running an EEG study to explore the neural correlates of curiosity---with possible impacts on personalization of human-robot interaction. |
