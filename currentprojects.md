Curiosity is a well-studied psychological phenomenon and a powerful motivating factor designers can leverage to increase user engagement, particularly in applications requiring long-term interaction (e.g., tutoring systems and health tracking tools). In the Curious Robot project, we aim to design a teachable social robot with the explicit goal of inducing students' curiosity about the material being taught, and use the teachable robot as an experimentation platform to study technology-mediated peer learning.

We worked with teachers to conceptualize possible robot roles and the effects they may have on the current way learning activities are designed, planned, and executed.

#### NEURAL CORRELATES OF CURIOSITY (2017-present)

In collaboration with [Inria Bordeaux](https://www.inria.fr/en/centre/bordeaux), we are running an EEG study to explore the neural correlates of curiosity---with possible impacts on personalization of human-robot interaction.
