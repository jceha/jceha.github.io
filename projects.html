			<p><strong>Verbal Curiosity Expression in a Social Robot.</strong> As curiosity has been found to enhance learning, memory, and exploration, understanding how to elicit curiosity can inform the design of educational technologies. In this work, we investigate how a social peer robot's verbal expression of curiosity is perceived, whether it can affect emotional and/or behavioural curiosity contagion in students, and how it impacts learning. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3290605.3300636">DOI</a>
