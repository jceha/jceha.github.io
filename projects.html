			<p><strong>Verbal Curiosity Expression in a Social Robot.</strong> As curiosity has been found to enhance learning, memory, and exploration, understanding how to elicit curiosity can inform the design of educational technologies. In this work, we investigate how a social peer robot's verbal expression of curiosity is perceived, whether it can affect emotional and/or behavioural curiosity contagion in students, and how it impacts learning. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/3290605.3300636">DOI</a>

<h4>Voice Perception - Cochlear Implants (2014-2016)<h4>
	<p> In discriminating speakers' voices, normal-hearing individuals effectively use two vocal characteristics, vocal pitch (related to fundamental frequency, F0) and vocal-tract length (VTL, related to speaker size). Typical cochlear-implant users show poor perception of these cues.</p>
<div class="flex-container-section">
	<div class="flex-container-image-and-text">
		<div class ="title-text">
			<p><strong>Bimodal Hearing.</strong> In implant users with low-frequency residual acoustic hearing, this bimodal electro-acoustic stimulation may provide additional voice-related cues, such as low-numbered harmonics and formants, which could improve F0/VTL perception. In acoustic noise-vocoder simulations, where added low-pass filtered speech simulated residual hearing, a strong bimodal benefit was observed for F0 perception. No bimodal benefit was observed for VTL, which seems to mainly rely on vocoder spectral resolution. <a href="https://doi.org/10.1121/1.5034171">DOI</a>

			<p><strong>Theta Oscillation Phase-Locking.</strong> EEG study on theta oscillation phase-locking after attentional blink (AB) training. The AB is a phenomenon which demonstrates the attention limitations of human visual processing. The cause of the AB is thought to be due to a reduction in processing capacity once the first target has been perceived, preventing the processing and conscious perception of a second target.

			<p><strong>Interruption Management System.</strong> With multitasking comes interruptions and there is a growing literature on the detrimental effects interruptions have on performance. When best to interrupt a user has become a major area of research in the field of HCI. We developed and tested a system which interrupted users based on their cognitive workload (measured by pupil dilation), and measured their performance by resumption lag.

			<p><strong>The Search For A Waving Person.</strong> With the use of a Kinect sensor and ROS modules a behaviour was built which searched for a waving person in a room by rotating on the spot by small intervals. Once the person was found the robot navigated to him or her and stopped directly in front at a face-to-face angle. Experiments were conducted to measure the accuracy of the behaviour.
