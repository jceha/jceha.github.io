#### PEDAGOGICAL CONVERSATIONAL AGENTS (2017 - present)


![Student and Robot playing game](/img/TeachableRobotProject.png#thumbnail){: .image-left }
**Verbal Curiosity Expression in a Social Robot.** As curiosity has been found to enhance learning, memory, and exploration, understanding how to elicit curiosity can inform the design of educational technologies. In this work, we investigate how a social peer robot's verbal expression of curiosity is perceived, whether it can affect emotional and/or behavioural curiosity contagion in students, and how it impacts learning.

Curiosity is a well-studied psychological phenomenon and a powerful motivating factor designers can leverage to increase user engagement, particularly in applications requiring long-term interaction (e.g., tutoring systems and health tracking tools). In the Curious Robot project, we aim to design a teachable social robot with the explicit goal of inducing students' curiosity about the material being taught, and use the teachable robot as an experimentation platform to study technology-mediated peer learning.

#### VOICE PERCEPTION - COCHLEAR IMPLANTS (2014-2016)

In discriminating speakers' voices, normal-hearing individuals effectively use two vocal characteristics, vocal pitch (related to fundamental frequency, F0) and vocal-tract length (VTL, related to speaker size). Typical cochlear-implant users show poor perception of these cues.

![spectrograms of 4, 8, and 16 bands in cochlear implant](/img/PsychoacousticExperiment.png#thumbnail2){: .image-left }
**Bimodal Hearing.**  In implant users with low-frequency residual acoustic hearing, this bimodal electro-acoustic stimulation may provide additional voice-related cues, such as low-numbered harmonics and formants, which could improve F0/VTL perception. In acoustic noise-vocoder simulations, where added low-pass filtered speech simulated residual hearing, a strong bimodal benefit was observed for F0 perception. No bimodal benefit was observed for VTL, which seems to mainly rely on vocoder spectral resolution. [https://doi.org/10.1121/1.5034171](https://doi.org/10.1121/1.5034171)<br>

**Neurofeedback (Brain-Computer Interface).**  Preliminary work on developing an electroencephalography (EEG) based neurofeedback system for improving  perception of F0 and VTL for cochlear implant users.<br>

#### COGNITIVE AND USER MODELLING (2015)

![eeg plot](/img/PhaseLocking3.png#thumbnail2){: .image-left }
 **Theta Oscillation Phase-Locking.** EEG study on theta oscillation phase-locking after attentional blink (AB) training. The AB is a phenomenon which demonstrates the attention limitations of human visual processing. The cause of the AB is thought to be due to a reduction in processing capacity once the first target has been perceived, preventing the processing and conscious perception of a second target.<br>

![Graphs of ACTR output](/img/actr.png#thumbnail3){: .image-left }
**ACT-R Cognitive Architecture.** How people make time estimations has been heavily researched over the years. This work provides a cognitive model based on analyses of data from a time estimation task. The model focusses on the role feedback plays on subsequent estimations and suggests ways in which memory traces are formed and retrieved.<br>

![Image showing interruption manaagement system](/img/interruptionmanagement.png#thumbnail2){: .image-left }
**Interruption Management System.** With multitasking comes interruptions and there is a growing literature on the detrimental effects interruptions have on performance. When best to interrupt a user has become a major area of research in the field of HCI. We developed and tested a system which interrupted users based on their cognitive workload (measured by pupil dilation), and measured their performance by resumption lag. (Similar work published by colleagues: [https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2016.1198525](  https://doi.org/10.1080/10447318.2016.1198525))<br>

#### HUMAN-ROBOT INTERACTION (2015-2016)

![Picture showing robot waving experiment](/img/robotwaving.png#thumbnail){: .image-left }
 **The Search For A Waving Person.** With the use of a Kinect sensor and ROS modules a behaviour was built which searched for a waving person in a room by rotating on the spot by small intervals. Once the person was found the robot navigated to him or her and stopped directly in front at a face-to-face angle. Experiments were conducted to measure the accuracy of the behaviour.<br>
